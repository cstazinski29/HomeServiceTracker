<h1>HomeServiceTracker</h1>

<p>Properly maintaining a home requires the homeowner to perform regular maintenance services.</p>
<p>For new homeowners especially, it can be hard to know what maintenance needs to be done & the frequency at which it needs to be done.</p>
<p>There is no set way to plan and track these services, and as a result the burden falls on the homeowner to keep up with it all.</p>
<p>HomeServiceTracker (name pending) allows homeowners to document recurring maintenance needs and track planned/completed services to ensure that the home is properly kept.</p>
