# HomeServiceTracker

Properly maintaining a home requires the homeowner to perform regular maintenance services. For new homeowners especially, it can be hard to know what maintenance needs to be done and the frequency at which it needs to be done. There is no set way to plan and track these services, and as a result the burden falls on the homeowner to keep up with it all.
    
**HomeServiceTracker** allows you to document and track Homes, Services, Scheduled Services, and Service Providers to help your home be properly kept.

### A note on your first use
When you first open the application, there will be no data. However, as you click the pages to view Homes, Services, and Service Providers, some initial data will populate. This will not happen with the Scheduled Services, as those are dependent upon information being in the other three areas first. Meaning, to see a Scheduled Service, you will need to create your own.
